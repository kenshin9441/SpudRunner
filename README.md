## Overview:
Genre: Historical Fiction: One player game

Platform: Twine
## Theme:
Between roughly 1845 and 1850, Ireland experienced a devastating famine that decreased their population by about a fifth. The Irish Potato Famine was caused by a potato blight, which is a mold that infected and spread across Ireland's potato population. The mold was accidentally picked up from the Americas and quickly made its way across the country. Potatoes were heavily depended upon for they were relatively easy to grow crops and calorie dense. Since around this time potatoes were a staple of the Irish diet and was a very typical food of the poor, this blight affected the Irish population disastrously. This led to a very high rate of death and emigration amongst the Irish. Many Irish tried to eat the infected potatoes and grew sick. If they did not eat the potatoes, many people became incredibly malnourished and sickly, leading them to additionally pick up fast spreading diseases like Typhus and Yellow Fever.
## Key Points:
An educational game that focuses on ‘The Great Famine’ aka the Great Irish Potato Famine.

The game is a single-player game that has one main character and 6 primary secondary characters. In addition to that there are about 6 other characters that the family and main character interact with along their journey. 

This main character is an Irish farmer who has a family. He is trying to keep is wife and kids healthy and safe as they try and emigrate from Ireland.  It is up to him as the male patriarch of the family to make decisions that impact him and his family. 

The game has text at the beginning that informs the player about the history and setting of the game. 

The goal of the player is to get to Galway and board a boat to New York. In order to do so, he must keep himself and his family safe.  There are multiple outcomes, some sadder than others depending on the player’s choices in the game. This game is similar to the well known game ‘The Oregon Trail’ except we chose a setting that is less well known to the general American population.  We used inspiration from other choice narratives to help us create a fun and interesting game that was also educational. 
## Gameplay:
The game starts with an introduction to set the scene and explain some of the histories about the Irish Potato Famine to the player. It follows with the simple gameplay tutorial.

The game player plays an Irish person trying to emigrate from the famine. The player must make many decisions on where he would go next, or on what to do in different situations based on the given information about the potato blight, the related diseases, etc. 

During the emigration, he will visit different places in hopes of bringing his family to safety and a better future. When all of the family members die, the game is over.
## Design Goals:
We want the player to understand the significance of the Irish Potato Famine, as it was a very important time in Ireland’s history. We researched the Famine and used varying sources to understand what it was actually like to live in that time (see works cited). The goal of this game is to demonstrate how hard it was for a typical poor farming family to survive such a turbulent time. The game should balance some education on the topic and simple fun so that anyone can play. During the actual gameplay, the player will learn about how important the potatoes were to Ireland, what happened during the famine, and information about potato blight. Since there is much that is not known to the common American population about the Irish potato blight, this game aims to uncover and educate players about different aspects that affected Irish people during this time. These include diseases such as Typhus and Yellow Fever that were spreading and caused many deaths. Many people not only starved but since they were so malnutritious, their bodies picked up diseases much easier which also facilitated the spread of disease. Another aspect is the general sense of dread and desperation that many of the Irish people felt. In the node where the main character is robbed, the player gets a sense of how turbulent a time it was and how lost and frustrated the main character feels.
